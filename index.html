            <p>Hello, my name is Garrett Cowley. I enjoy reading, cooking, and playing video games. I spend most of my time with my beautiful wife whom I married just over 2 years ago. I live in Dallas Texas and am super grateful to be able to go to school online and pursue a degree despite having moved recently!</p>
